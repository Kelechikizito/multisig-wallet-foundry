# User Flow: Multi-Signature Wallet with Time Locks

Let me walk you through how users would actually interact with this wallet step-by-step.

## Setup Phase (One-time)

**1. Wallet Creation**
```
Admin ‚Üí Deploys contract ‚Üí Sets 5 owners ‚Üí Requires 3 signatures
```
- Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, and Eve are the 5 wallet owners
- Any transaction needs 3 out of 5 signatures to execute
- Time delays: >10 ETH = 48 hours, >1 ETH = 24 hours, <1 ETH = instant

## Daily Transaction Flow

### **Scenario 1: Small Transaction (0.5 ETH)**

**Step 1: Proposal**
```
Alice wants to send 0.5 ETH to pay contractor
Alice ‚Üí Calls proposeTransaction(contractorAddress, 0.5 ETH, "")
Contract ‚Üí Creates Transaction ID #123
```

**Step 2: Signatures**
```
Bob ‚Üí Signs transaction #123 (1/3 signatures)
Charlie ‚Üí Signs transaction #123 (2/3 signatures) 
Diana ‚Üí Signs transaction #123 (3/3 signatures ‚úì)
```

**Step 3: Immediate Execution**
```
Anyone ‚Üí Calls executeTransaction(123)
Contract ‚Üí Checks: 3 signatures ‚úì, amount <1 ETH ‚úì, no timelock needed
Transaction ‚Üí Executes immediately, 0.5 ETH sent
```

### **Scenario 2: Large Transaction (15 ETH)**

**Step 1: Proposal**
```
Alice ‚Üí Proposes sending 15 ETH to exchange
Contract ‚Üí Creates Transaction #124, timestamp = now
```

**Step 2: Signatures**
```
Bob ‚Üí Signs #124 (1/3)
Charlie ‚Üí Signs #124 (2/3)
Diana ‚Üí Signs #124 (3/3 signatures met ‚úì)
```

**Step 3: Time Lock Enforced**
```
Anyone ‚Üí Tries to execute #124
Contract ‚Üí "Wait! 15 ETH > 10 ETH threshold"
Contract ‚Üí "Must wait 48 hours from proposal time"
Contract ‚Üí Current status: "Pending, executable in 47 hours, 23 minutes"
```

**Step 4: Waiting Period**
```
‚è∞ 48 hours pass...
Anyone ‚Üí Calls executeTransaction(124)
Contract ‚Üí Checks: 3 signatures ‚úì, 48 hours passed ‚úì
Transaction ‚Üí Executes, 15 ETH sent
```

## User Interface Flow

### **Web Dashboard View**

**Pending Transactions Tab:**
```
ID #124: Send 15 ETH to 0x123...abc
Status: ‚è∞ Waiting (6 hours remaining)
Signatures: ‚úì Alice ‚úì Bob ‚úì Charlie ‚ùå Diana ‚ùå Eve
Your Action: [Already Signed] 
```

**Transaction History:**
```
‚úÖ #123: 0.5 ETH sent (Instant) - 2 days ago
‚è∞ #124: 15 ETH pending (6h left) - 2 days ago  
‚ùå #122: 2 ETH cancelled - 3 days ago
```

## Edge Cases & User Scenarios

### **Scenario 3: Transaction Gets Cancelled**

**During Waiting Period:**
```
Day 1: Alice proposes 20 ETH withdrawal
Day 1: Bob, Charlie, Diana sign (3/3 met)
Day 2: Team realizes it's a mistake
Charlie ‚Üí Calls revokeConfirmation(124)
Result: Back to 2/3 signatures, transaction can't execute
```

### **Scenario 4: Emergency Override**

**Critical Situation:**
```
Exchange hack detected! Need to move funds NOW
Eve (emergency admin) ‚Üí Calls emergencyExecute(125)
Contract ‚Üí Bypasses timelock for designated emergency admin
All funds ‚Üí Moved to cold storage immediately
```

### **Scenario 5: Signature Collection**

**Real-world coordination:**
```
Alice: "I proposed transaction #126 in our group chat"
Bob: "I'll sign when I get home"
Charlie: "Signed! ‚úì"  
Diana: "What's this for? Need more details"
Alice: "It's for the new office deposit, check the memo"
Diana: "Got it, signing now ‚úì"
```

## Mobile App Flow

**Notification:**
```
üì± "New transaction proposed: 5 ETH to supplier"
   [View Details] [Sign] [Ignore]
```

**Signing Process:**
```
User opens app ‚Üí Face ID/Touch ID ‚Üí Review transaction details
‚Üí [Confirm Signature] ‚Üí "Signed! 2/3 signatures collected"
```

## What Users See vs. What Happens Behind the Scenes

### **User sees:**
- "Transaction pending approval (2/3 signatures)"
- "Will execute in 23 hours, 15 minutes"
- Simple [Sign] or [Execute] buttons

### **Contract does:**
- Validates each signature cryptographically
- Tracks timestamps precisely
- Prevents double-signing
- Calculates exact execution times
- Manages complex state transitions

## Key User Benefits

**Security:** "Even if 2 people get hacked, funds are safe"
**Transparency:** "Everyone sees what's happening"
**Control:** "Big moves need consensus AND time to think"
**Flexibility:** "Small payments don't get delayed"

This flow makes complex crypto security feel as simple as "propose ‚Üí sign ‚Üí wait ‚Üí execute" while handling all the cryptographic complexity behind the scenes.
