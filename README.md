# Multi-Signature Wallet with Time Locks

## Core Concept
A multisig wallet requires multiple signatures to execute transactions, but adds **time delays** for extra security. Think of it as a digital safe that needs multiple keys AND a waiting period for large withdrawals.

## Basic Logic Flow

### 1. **Transaction Proposal**
```
User A wants to send 100 ETH → Creates proposal → Stored in contract
```

### 2. **Signature Collection**
```
Proposal needs 3/5 signatures → Users B, C, D sign → Threshold met
```

### 3. **Time Lock Check**
```
Large amount? → Wait 48 hours → Then execute
Small amount? → Execute immediately
```

## Key Components & Integrations

### **Smart Contract Architecture**

**Main Contract: MultiSigTimelock.sol**
- Stores wallet owners and signature requirements
- Manages proposals and their status
- Enforces time delays based on transaction size

**Key Data Structures:**
```solidity
struct Transaction {
    address to;
    uint256 value;
    bytes data;
    uint256 confirmations;
    uint256 proposedAt;
    bool executed;
    mapping(address => bool) signatures;
}
```

### **Required Integrations**

**1. Access Control**
- Owner management (add/remove signers)
- Signature threshold configuration
- Role-based permissions

**2. Time Lock Logic**
- Different delays for different transaction sizes
- Emergency override mechanisms
- Grace periods for cancellation

**3. Oracle Integration (Optional)**
- USD value conversion for consistent thresholds
- Price feeds from Chainlink for ETH/token values

## Technical Requirements

### **Core Functions**
- `proposeTransaction()` - Create new transaction proposal
- `confirmTransaction()` - Add signature to proposal
- `executeTransaction()` - Execute after requirements met
- `revokeConfirmation()` - Remove signature before execution

### **Security Features**
- **Reentrancy protection** using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- **Signature verification** to prevent replay attacks
- **Transaction expiration** to prevent stale executions
- **Emergency pause** functionality

### **Time Lock Tiers**
```solidity
// Example thresholds
if (amount > 100 ETH) timelock = 7 days;
else if (amount > 10 ETH) timelock = 48 hours;
else if (amount > 1 ETH) timelock = 24 hours;
else timelock = 0; // Immediate execution
```

## Development Tools You'll Need

### **Foundry Setup**
- **forge** for compilation and testing
- **anvil** for local blockchain simulation
- **cast** for contract interactions

### **Testing Strategy**
```solidity
// Test scenarios to cover:
- Multiple signature collection
- Time lock enforcement
- Edge cases (exactly at threshold)
- Malicious behavior prevention
- Gas optimization
```

### **External Dependencies**
```solidity
// Key imports you'll likely use:
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";
```

## Real-World Use Cases

**1. DAO Treasury Management**
- Large fund movements need community consensus + waiting period
- Prevents rushed decisions during market volatility

**2. Corporate Crypto Holdings**
- Multiple executives must approve large transfers
- Time delay allows for intervention if compromise detected

**3. Family Crypto Inheritance**
- Multiple family members control shared funds
- Time locks prevent impulsive spending

## Hackathon Enhancement Ideas

**1. **Social Recovery Integration**
- If X signers are inactive for Y days, allow recovery process
- Backup signers can step in

**2. **Mobile App Integration**
- QR code signing for mobile wallets
- Push notifications for pending transactions

**3. **Analytics Dashboard**
- Transaction history and patterns
- Spending insights and budgeting

**4. **Integration with DeFi**
- Direct staking/lending from multisig
- Yield optimization while maintaining security

## Complexity Level
**Intermediate** - You'll practice:
- Advanced state management
- Security best practices
- Time-based logic
- Multi-party coordination
- Gas optimization
